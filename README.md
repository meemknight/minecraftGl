- So far I have managed to add a working cross platform screen setup, add a camera and a texture atlas to render faces.

-Then i managed to make a chunk to be rendered and a mesh builder to only display the faces that can actually be seen.

-After that it was time to add more chunks and a chumk manager that can load chunks near the player.

-Then it was time to optimize the game so that chunks would only process their mesh once.
Also i had to make shure that i only draw chunks that are visible to the payer
